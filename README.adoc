= FLaP &mdash; Flat LaTeX Projects

Flap is a simple utility that flattens LaTeX projects. It takes a well organised LaTeX project 
&mdash; one you so carefully crafted &mdash; and merged it into a vulgar single LaTeX file 
in a flat directory.

Why to do so? Some publisher requires such a flat structure when you submit the sources of your 
manuscript and I got tired to do that by hand.
